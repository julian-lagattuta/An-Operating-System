# My Operating System

I wanted to learn about how operating systems work. 

I followed various tutorials from http://www.osdever.net/

This project is incomplete. It boots itself up into VGA mode using GRUB. It can handle keyboard inputs, faults, exceptions, and traps. It runs in EMU. 

If you want to compile it yourself, run `build.sh.`
Then run `run.sh`
If you want to debug, use `debug.sh`
